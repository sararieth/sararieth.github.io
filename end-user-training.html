										<h3>Overview</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										This set of guides tailored to K-12 educators has remained a popular, active resource since its initial launch in 2015. During the pandemic, site visits to the education portal surged, and we were given the opportunity to refresh and add new content to better support educators as they managed their classrooms remotely. As of 2025, the portal continues to draw daily learners, with total lifetime views surpassing 3 million.
